Hi there!

This repo contains my solutions to Wes Bos's Array Cardio Practice - Day 1 from his Javascript 30 Challenge. Here's a link to the YouTube video:

Some of my answers differ a bit from what is the video simply because I wrote out the solutions in a manner that made the most sense to me at the time. :)
